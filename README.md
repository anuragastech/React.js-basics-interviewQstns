# **What is React?**

React is an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** designed for building **composable user interfaces**. It is widely used for:

- **Single-page applications (SPAs)**
- Handling the **view layer** of web and mobile apps
- Creating reusable and dynamic **components** using a declarative approach

React is maintained by **Meta** (formerly Facebook) and a community of developers. Its core strengths include:

- **Fast rendering** with a virtual DOM
- **Component-based architecture** for scalability
- Ease of integration with other libraries or frameworks
